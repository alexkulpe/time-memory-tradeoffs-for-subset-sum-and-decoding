# Time-Memory Tradeoffs for Subset Sum and Decoding
This repository contains the scripts (and maybe the data) used in my Master Thesis "Time-Memory Tradeoffs f√ºr Subset Sum und Dekodierung" (english: Time-Memory Tradeoffs for Subset Sum and Decoding). The german thesis and/or an english translation might follow later.


The script is based on
